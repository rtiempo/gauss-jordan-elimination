            <p>The Gauss-Jordan Elimination method is a powerful technique used in linear algebra to solve systems of linear equations and find solutions for unknown variables. By performing a series of elementary row operations, the augmented matrix is
                transformed into its reduced row-echelon form, leading to a simplified system of equations.</p>
            <p>You can enter your system of linear equations into the calculator web-based app here, and it will use the Gauss-Jordan Elimination method to get the answer. It offers a practical and effective method for resolving intricate systems and carrying
                out matrix operations.</p>
            <p>With this calculator, you can save time and effort by automating the steps involved in Gauss-Jordan Elimination, reducing the chance of human error and obtaining accurate results. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional
                working with linear algebra, this calculator can be a valuable tool in your mathematical endeavors.</p>
